SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================
Install a copy of 32-bit Anaconda Python and paste the directory in the file "miniconda_path.txt".
32-bit environment is required for the motor communication libraries.

Get a copy of the VC++ Compiler for Python 2.7 from aka.ms/vcpython27. Install it. (Reqd for 
the twisted package install from pip.)

Open a conda command prompt (there should be a shortcut in your Start Menu on Windows).
Type conda env create -f conda_environment.yaml.

Should be good to go!!! Just run start_server.bat

send me an email at jdmls27@gmail.com if you have any questions.
